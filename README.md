# Elusive-Numbers
This is a number guessing game.
I am a little new to programming I am hoping some of you more experienced developers can take a look at this code and let me know any ways I can make it better. The program works, but is having problems when user enters a negative integer while setting the range and attempts. Any advice is welcome and thank you!
